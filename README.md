# SyMole.ai
## Description 

This is a suite of two Health Services. A Heart Disease Classifier and an AI Therapist. We believe that health and well-being are primarily the most important components of life. 
Cardiovascular Diseases account to about 24.8% of deaths per year in India. The Heart Disease Classifier would provide such information which,if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.
